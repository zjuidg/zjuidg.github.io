    "abstract": "The increased availability of quantitative historical datasets has provided new research opportunities for multiple disciplines in social science. In this paper, we work closely with the constructors of a new dataset, CGED-Q (China Government Employee Database-Qing), that records the career trajectories of over 340,000 government officials in the Qing bureaucracy in China from 1760 to 1912. We use these data to study career mobility from a historical perspective and understand social mobility and inequality. However, existing statistical approaches are inadequate for analyzing career mobility in this historical dataset with its fine-grained attributes and long time span, since they are mostly hypothesis-driven and require substantial effort. We propose CareerLens, an interactive visual analytics system for assisting experts in exploring, understanding, and reasoning from historical career data. With CareerLens, experts examine mobility patterns in three levels-of-detail, namely, the macro-level providing a summary of overall mobility, the meso-level extracting latent group mobility patterns, and the micro-level revealing social relationships of individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of CareerLens through two case studies and receive encouraging feedback from follow-up interviews with domain experts.",

    "abstract": "Many spatiotemporal events can be viewed as contagions. These events implicitly propagate across space and time by following cascading patterns, expanding their influence, and generating event cascades that involve multiple locations. Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges, 1) generalized pattern inference, 2) implicit influence visualization, and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts.",

    "abstract": "In table tennis, tactics specified by three consecutive strokes represent the high-level competition strategies in matches. Effective detection and analysis of tactics can reveal the playing styles of players, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. However, tactical analysis in table tennis is challenging as the analysts can often be overwhelmed by the large quantity and high dimension of the data. Statistical charts have been extensively used by researchers to explore and visualize table tennis data. However, these charts cannot support efficient comparative and correlation analysis of complicated tactic attributes. Besides, existing studies are limited to the analysis of one match. However, one player's strategy can change along with his/her opponents in different matches. Therefore, the data of multiple matches can support a more comprehensive tactical analysis. To address these issues, we introduced a visual analytics system called Tac-Miner to allow analysts to effectively analyze, explore, and compare tactics of multiple matches based on the advanced embedding and dimension reduction algorithms along with an interactive glyph. We evaluate our glyph's usability through a user study and demonstrate the system's usefulness through a case study with insights approved by coaches and domain experts.",

Our approach uses machine learning models in computer vision to help users acquire essential events from videos (e.g., serve, the ball bouncing on the court) and offers users a set of interactive tools for data annotation. An evaluation study on a table tennis annotation system built on this framework shows significant improvement of user performances in simple annotation tasks on objects of interest and complex annotation tasks requiring domain knowledge.",

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AIagent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storylinevisualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both theagent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines.

    "abstract": "Bus routes are typically updated every 3–5 years to meet constantly changing travel demands. However, identifying deficientbus routes and finding their optimal replacements remain challenging due to the difficulties in analyzing a complex bus network and thelarge solution space comprising alternative routes. Most of the automated approaches cannot produce satisfactory results in real-worldsettings without laborious inspection and evaluation of the candidates. The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us tocollaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning ofbus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depthanalysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation ofalternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus networkinto three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model andinterpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy inthe progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one. Theproposed system is evaluated with two usage scenarios based on real-world data and received positive feedback from the experts.",

Experts are interested in analyzing players’ passing behavior to learn passing tactics, i.e., how players build up an attack with passing. Various approaches have been proposed to facilitate the analysis of passing tactics. However, the dynamic changes of a team’semployed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively investigated. To address the problem, we closely collaborate withdomain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a team’s passing tactics. To characterize thepassing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passingbehaviors. Based on the model, we propose a glyph-based design to reveal the multi-variate information of passing tactics withindifferent phases of attacks, including player identity, spatial context, and formation. We further design and develop PassVizor, a visualanalytics system, to support the comprehensive analysis of passing dynamics. With the system, users can detect the changing patternsof passing tactics and examine the detailed passing process for evaluating passing tactics.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have beenwidely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players’ performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often presentthe trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on thecourt and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality(VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player’s perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rootedin data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact withdata without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have workedfor a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3Dvisualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights. We further conduct interviews with the expertswhose feedback confirms that our first-person immersive analytics system is suitable and useful for analyzing badminton data.",

Each hit can be described with a set of attributes, suchas the positions of the ball and the techniques used to hit the ball(such asdriveandvolleyin tennis). Thus, the mentioned sequence ofhits can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. By detecting andanalyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in therallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into theplaying styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help themidentify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counterstrategies in matches. To support such analysis effectively, wepropose a steerable multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithmwith adjustable weights over event attributes, such that the domainexpert can obtain frequent tactical patterns according to the attributesspecified by himself. We also propose a re-configurable glyph designto help users simultaneously analyze multiple attributes of the hits. The framework further supports comparative analysis of the tacticalpatterns, e.g., for different athletes or the same athlete playing underdifferent conditions. By applying the framework on two datasetscollected in tennis and badminton matches, we demonstrate thatthe system is generic and effective for tactic analysis in sports andcan help identify signature techniques used by individual athletes.Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposedapproach based on the feedback from the domain experts.",

To inform the transition designs in data videos, we conduct a content analysis based on more than 3500 clips extracted from 284 data videos. We annotate visualization types and transition designs on these segments, and examine how these transitions help make connections between contexts. We propose a taxonomy of transitions in data videos, where two transition categories are defined in building fluent narratives by using visual variables.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of sensing technologies, massive spatiotemporal data have been acquired from the urban space with respect to different domains, such as transportation and environment. Numerous co-occurrence patterns (e.g., traffic speed < 10km/h, weather = foggy, and air quality = unhealthy) between the transportation data and other types of data can be obtained with given spatiotemporal constraints (e.g., within 3 kilometers and lasting for 2 hours) from these heterogeneous data sources. Such patterns present valuable implications for many urban applications, such as traffic management, pollution diagnosis, and transportation planning. However, extracting and understanding these patterns is beyond manual capability because of the scale, diversity, and heterogeneity of the data. To address this issue, a novel visual analytics system called CorVizor is proposed to identify and interpret these co-occurrence patterns. CorVizor comprises two major components. The first component is a co-occurrence mining framework involving three steps, namely, spatiotemporal indexing, co-occurring instance generation, and pattern mining. The second component is a visualization technique called CorView that implements a level-of-detail mechanism by integrating tailored visualizations to depict the extracted spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns. The case studies and expert interviews are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of CorVizor.",

However, finding such routes is computationally difficult due to the huge solution space constituted by billions of possible routes. Considering the limited scalability of exact search methods, heuristic search methods were proposed to boost the efficiency and incorporate flexible constraints. Nevertheless, the existing methods conceal multiple criteria in an objective, and thus evaluating the performance of the generated route becomes challenging due to the lack of comparable alternatives. Inspired by the prior study, we formulate the definition of pareto-optimal transit routes based on multiple criteria. However, extracting these routes remains challenging because: A) the sheer volume of possible transit routes; and B) the sparsity of pareto-optimal routes. We address these challenges by developing an efficient search framework: for challenge A, a random search method is developed based on Monte Carlo tree search where the unproductive solution subspaces are pruned progressively to reduce the search cost; and for challenge B, an estimation method is derived to guide the search process by assessing the value for each solution subspace. The superior effectiveness of our approach in approximating the pareto-optimal transit routes was demonstrated by the comprehensive evaluation based on the real-world data.",

However, due to the dynamics of human mobility patterns, people are distributed unevenly on the spatial and temporal domains. As a result, in many cases, redundant resources have to be deployed to meet the crowd coverage requirements, which leads to high deployment costs and low usage. Fortunately, with the development of unmanned vehicles, the dynamic allocation of those public resources becomes possible. To this end, we provide the first attempt to design an effective and efficient scheduling algorithm for the dynamic public resource allocation. We formulate the problem as a novel multi-agent long-term maximal coverage scheduling (MALMCS) problem, which considers the crowd coverage and the energy limitation during a whole day. Two main components are employed in the system: 1) multi-step crowd flow prediction, which makes multi-step crowd flow prediction given the current crowd flows and external factors; and 2) energy adaptive scheduling, which employs a two-step heuristic algorithm, i.e., energy adaptive scheduling (EADS), to generate a scheduling plan that maximizes the crowd coverage within the service time for agents. Extensive experiments based on real crowd flow data in Happy Valley (a popular theme park in Beijing) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

It is very useful in many urban applications: 1) traffic modeling, 2) frequent path mining, 3) intersection coordination, and 4) traffic anomaly detection. Existing solutions for path query processing are implemented based on single machines, which are not efficient for the following tasks: 1) indexing large-scale historical data; 2) handling real-time trajectory updates; and 3) processing concurrent path queries from urban data mining applications. In this paper, we design and implement a cloud-based path query processing framework based on Microsoft Azure. We modify existing suffix tree structure to index trajectories using Azure Table. The proposed system consists of two main parts: 1) back-end processing, which performs pre-processing (i.e., parsing and map-matching) and index building tasks with a distributed computing platform (i.e., Storm) used to efficiently handle massive real-time trajectory updates; and 2) query processing, which answers path queries using Azure Storm to improve efficiency and overcome I/O bottleneck. Extensive experiments are performed based on the real-time taxi trajectories from Guiyang City, the capital of Guizhou Province, China to confirm the system efficiency. We also demonstrate a real deployed traffic analysis system based on our query processing framework.",

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

However, adequately simulating the complex competition process and effectively explaining the simulation result to domain experts are typically challenging.

We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights. The domain experts also provide positive feedback on the usability of Tac-Simur. Our work can be extended to other similar sports such as tennis and badminton.",

However, enabling non-experts to create data visualization in mobile AR environments is challenging given the lack of tools that allow in-situ design while supporting the binding of data to AR content. Most existing AR authoring tools require working on personal computers or manually creating each virtual object and modifying its visual attributes. We systematically study this issue by identifying the specificity of AR glyph-based visualization authoring tool and distill four design considerations. Following these design considerations, we design and implement MARVisT, a mobile authoring tool that leverages information from reality to assist non-experts in addressing relationships between data and virtual glyphs, real objects and virtual glyphs, and real objects and data. With MARVisT, users without visualization expertise can bind data to real-world objects to create expressive AR glyph-based visualizations rapidly and effortlessly, reshaping the representation of the real world with data. We use several examples to demonstrate the expressiveness of MARVisT. A user study with non-experts is also conducted to evaluate the authoring experience of MARVisT.",

The spatio-temporal nature of formations and other characteristics of soccer data, such as multivariate features, make analysis of formations in soccer a challenging problem. In this study, we closely worked with domain experts to characterize domain problems of formation analysis in soccer and formulated several design goals. We design a novel spatio-temporal visual representation of changes in team formation, allowing analysts to visually analyze the evolution of formations and track the spatial flow of players within formations over time. Based on the new design, we further design and develop ForVizor, a visual analytics system, which empowers users to track the spatio-temporal changes in formation and understand how and why such changes occur. With ForVizor, domain experts conduct formation analysis of two games. Analysis results with insights and useful feedback are summarized in two case studies.",

However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.",

However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. We also compared the hand-drawn storylines with storylines generated by the state-of-the-art methods and found they have significant differences. Our findings led to a design space that summarizes (1) how artists utilize narrative elements and (2) the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed iStoryline, an authoring tool for integrating high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieving a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create novel storyline visualizations easily according to their preferences by modifying the automatically generated layouts.

    "abstract": "Interactive visualization of large image collections is important and useful in many applications, such as personal album management and user profiling on images. However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.",

    "abstract": "The use of scatterplots is an important method for multivariate data visualization. The point distribution on the scatterplot, along with variable values represented by each point, can help analyze underlying patterns in data. However, determining the multivariate data variation on a scatterplot generated using projection methods, such as multidimensional scaling, is difficult. Furthermore, the point distribution becomes unclear when the data scale is large and clutter problems occur. These conditions can significantly decrease the usability of scatterplots on multivariate data analysis. In this study, we present a cluster-based visual abstraction method to enhance the visualization of multivariate scatterplots. Our method leverages an adapted multilabel clustering method to provide abstractions of high quality for scatterplots. An image-based method is used to deal with large scale data problem. Furthermore, a suite of glyphs is designed to visualize the data at different levels of detail and support data exploration. The view coordination between the glyph-based visualization and the table lens can effectively enhance the multivariate data analysis. Through numerical evaluations for data abstraction quality, case studies and a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed techniques for multivariate data analysis on scatterplots.",

This data recording creates opportunities to analyze and evaluate matches from new perspectives. Nevertheless, the increasingly complex data poses a significant challenge to make sense of and gain insights into. Analysts usually employ tedious and cumbersome methods which are limited to watching videos and reading statistical tables. However, existing sports visualization methods cannot be applied to visualizing table tennis competitions due to different competition rules and particular data attributes. In this work, we collaborate with data analysts to understand and characterize the sophisticated domain problem of analysis of table tennis data. We propose iTTVis, a novel interactive table tennis visualization system, which to our knowledge, is the first visual analysis system for analyzing and exploring table tennis data. iTTVis provides a holistic visualization of an entire match from three main perspectives, namely, time-oriented, statistical, and tactical analyses. The proposed system with several well-coordinated views not only supports correlation identification through statistics and pattern detection of tactics with a score timeline but also allows cross analysis to gain insights. Data analysts have obtained several new insights by using iTTVis. The effectiveness and usability of the proposed system are demonstrated with four case studies.",

However, they may not express the familiarity and aesthetic sense of users for features of interest. In this paper, we propose an image-based viewpoint selection model to learn how visualization experts choose representative viewpoints for volumes with similar features. For a given volume, we first collect images with similar features, and these images reflect the viewpoint preferences of the experts when visualizing these features. Each collected image tallies votes to the viewpoints with the best matching based on an image similarity measure, which evaluates the spatial shape and appearance similarity between the collected image and the rendered image from the viewpoint. The optimal viewpoint is the one with the most votes from the collected images, that is, the viewpoint chosen by most visualization experts for similar features. We performed experiments on various volumes available in volume visualization, and made comparisons with traditional viewpoint selection methods. The results demonstrate that our model can select more canonical viewpoints, which are consistent with human perception.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented availability of social media data offers substantial opportunities for data owners, system operators, solution providers, and end users to explore and understand social dynamics. However, the exponential growth in the volume, velocity, and variability of social media data prevents people from fully utilizing such data. Visual analytics, which is an emerging research direction, has received considerable attention in recent years. Many visual analytics methods have been proposed across disciplines to understand large-scale structured and unstructured social media data. This objective, however, also poses significant challenges for researchers to obtain a comprehensive picture of the area, understand research challenges, and develop new techniques. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey to characterize this fast-growing area and summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for analyzing social media data. In particular, we classify existing techniques into two categories: gathering information and understanding user behaviors. We aim to provide a clear overview of the research area through the established taxonomy. We then explore the design space and identify the research trends. Finally, we discuss challenges and open questions for future studies.",

These influential locations are valuable for resource allocation applications, such as selecting charging stations for electric automobiles and suggesting locations for placing billboards. This problem is NP-hard and usually calls for an interactive mining processes involving a user's input, e.g., changing the spatial region and k, or removing some locations (from the results in the previous round) that are not eligible for an application according to the domain knowledge. Efficiency is the major concern in conducting this human-in-the-loop mining. To this end, we propose a complete mining framework, which includes an optimal method for the light setting (i.e., small region and k) and an approximate method for the heavy setting (i.e., large region and k). The optimal method leverages vertex grouping and best-first pruning techniques to expedite the mining process. The approximate method can provide the performance guarantee by utilizing the greedy heuristic, and it is comprised of efficient updating strategy, index partition and workload-based optimization techniques. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods based on two taxi datasets from China, and one check-in dataset from New York.",

Many experiments have been carried out to study human perception of the pie chart, while the corresponding aspects of the doughnut chart have seldom been tested, even though the doughnut chart and the pie chart share several similarities. In this paper, we report on a series of experiments in which we explored the effect of a few fundamental design parameters of doughnut charts, and additional visual cues, on the accuracy of such charts for proportion estimates. Since mobile devices are becoming the primary devices for casual reading, we performed all our experiments on such device. Moreover, the screen size of mobile devices is limited and it is therefore important to know how such size constraint affects the proportion accuracy. For this reason, in our first experiment we tested the chart size and we found that it has no significant effect on proportion accuracy. In our second experiment, we focused on the effect of the doughnut chart inner radius and we found that the proportion accuracy is insensitive to the inner radius, except the case of the thinnest doughnut chart. In the third experiment, we studied the effect of visual cues and found that marking the centre of the doughnut chart or adding tick marks at 25% intervals improves the proportion accuracy. Based on the results of the three experiments, we discuss the design of doughnut charts and offer suggestions for improving the accuracy of proportion estimates.",

In addition, we developed an improved data-driven model for approximating reachability with massive taxi trajectories. This model enables users to interactively integrate their knowledge and preferences to make judicious and informed decisions.

How and to what extent will the information on social media achieve widespread diffusion across the world? How can we quantify the interaction between users from different geolocations in the diffusion process? How will the spatial patterns of information diffusion change over time? To address these questions, a dynamic social gravity model (SGM) is proposed to quantify the dynamic spatial interaction behavior among social media users in information diffusion. The dynamic SGM includes three factors that are theoretically significant to the spatial diffusion of information: geographic distance, cultural proximity, and linguistic similarity. Temporal dimension is also taken into account to help detect recency effect, and ground-truth data is integrated into the model to help measure the diffusion power. Furthermore, SocialWave, a visual analytic system, is developed to support both spatial and temporal investigative tasks. SocialWave provides a temporal visualization that allows users to quickly identify the overall temporal diffusion patterns, which reflect the spatial characteristics of the diffusion network. When a meaningful temporal pattern is identified, SocialWave utilizes a new occlusion-free spatial visualization, which integrates a node-link diagram into a circular cartogram for further analysis. Moreover, we propose a set of rich user interactions that enable in-depth, multi-faceted analysis of the diffusion on social media. The effectiveness and efficiency of the mathematical model and visualization system are evaluated with two datasets on social media, namely, Ebola Epidemics and Ferguson Unrest.",

In this paper, we design and implement a cloud-based path query processing framework based on Microsoft Azure. We modify the suffix tree structure to index the trajectories using Azure Table. The proposed system consists of two main parts: 1) backend processing, which performs the pre-processing and suffix index building with distributed computing platform (i.e., Storm) used to efficiently handle massive real-time trajectory updates; and 2) query processing, which answers path queries using Azure Storm to improve efficiency and overcome the I/O bottleneck.

The in-game currency price, an important indicator of a virtual economy, is highly contingent on players’ behavioral interaction in MMORPGs. The purpose of this paper is to adopt a network perspective to examine how topological characteristics of social networks in an MMORPG, namely, network externalities, density, and closure, would exert impacts on the in-game currency price. Players’ behavioral data were collected from a popular MMORPG in China on a weekly basis for 52 weeks. With a time series analytical approach, the empirical model for the price function of in-game currency was estimated with vector autoregression. The results show that the number of core avatars and network density are positively associated with in-game currency price, while network closure has a negative effect on in-game currency price. However, in-game currency price is found to have no significant relationship with the trade volume of the currency. This study fills in an important research gap by investigating factors influencing the in-game currency price of MMORPGs from a network perspective, which contributes to the existing literature of network effects and advances our understanding about how players’ interaction will influence the dynamics of a virtual economy. The findings could offer useful insights for online game companies to better understand their players’ social interaction and consumption behavior.",

This system has been demonstrated using case studies with a real-world dataset and domain-expert interviews.

    "abstract": "Analysis and exploration of spatio-temporal data such as traffic flow and vehicle trajectories have become important in urban planning and management. In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique called route-zooming that can embed spatio-temporal information into a map seamlessly for occlusion-free visualization of both spatial and temporal data. The proposed technique can broaden a selected route in a map by deforming the overall road network. We formulate the problem of route-zooming as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by defining an energy function that ensures the route is broadened successfully on demand while the distortion caused to the road network is minimized. The spatio-temporal information can then be embedded into the route to reveal both spatial and temporal patterns without occluding the spatial context information. The route-zooming technique is applied in two instantiations including an interactive metro map for city tourism and illustrative maps to highlight information on the broadened roads to prove its applicability. We demonstrate the usability of our spatio-temporal visualization approach with case studies on real traffic flow data. We also study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and choices of temporal display, and conduct a comprehensive user study to validate our embedded visualization design.",

    "abstract": "Stacked graphs have been widely adopted in various fields, because they are capable of hierarchically visualizing a set of temporal sequences as well as their aggregation. However, because of visual illusion issues, connections between overly-detailed individual layers and overly-generalized aggregation are intercepted. Consequently, information in this area has yet to be fully excavated. Thus, we present PieceStack in this paper, to reveal the relevance of stacked graphs in understanding intrinsic details of their displayed shapes. This new visual analytic design interprets the ways through which aggregations are generated with individual layers by interactively splitting and re-constructing the stacked graphs. A clustering algorithm is designed to partition stacked graphs into sub-aggregated pieces based on trend similarities of layers. We then visualize the pieces with augmented encoding to help analysts decompose and explore the graphs with respect to their interests. Case studies and a user study are conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of our technique in understanding the formation of stacked graphs.",

    "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) aim to facilitate open-access and massive-participation education. These courses have attracted millions of learners recently. At present, most MOOC platforms record the Web log data of learner interactions with course videos. Such large amounts of multivariate data pose a new challenge in terms of analyzing online learning behaviors. Previous studies have mainly focused on the aggregate behaviors of learners from a summative view; however, few attempts have been made to conduct a detailed analysis of such behaviors. To determine complex learning patterns in MOOC video interactions, this paper introduces a comprehensive visualization system called PeakVizor. This system enables course instructors and education experts to analyze the “peaks” or the video segments that generate numerous clickstreams. The system features three views at different levels: the overview with glyphs to display valuable statistics regarding the peaks detected; the flow view to present spatio-temporal information regarding the peaks; and the correlation view to show the correlation between different learner groups and the peaks. Case studies and interviews conducted with domain experts have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of PeakVizor, and new findings about learning behaviors in MOOC platforms have been reported.",

    "abstract": "The digital traces of U.S. members of congress on Twitter enable researchers to observe how these public officials interact with one another in a direct and unobtrusive manner. Using data from Twitter and other sources (e.g., roll-call vote data), this study aims to examine how members of congress connect and communicate with one another on Twitter, why they will connect and communicate with one another in such a way, and what effects such connection and communication among members of congress have on their floor vote behavior. The follower-followee and communication networks of members of congress on Twitter demonstrate a high degree of partisan homogeneity. Members of congress prefer to follow or communicate with other members who are similar to them in terms of partisanship, home state, chamber, and public concern. This condition is known as the homophily effect in social network research. However, the magnitude of the homophily effect is mitigated when the effects of endogenous networking mechanisms (i.e., reciprocity and triadic closure) in such networks are controlled. Follower-followee ties can facilitate political discourse among members of congress on Twitter, whereas both follower-followee and communication ties on Twitter increase the likelihood of vote agreement among members of congress. The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of the findings are addressed.",
